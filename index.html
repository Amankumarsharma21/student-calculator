  <h2>CGPA Calculator</h2>
  <p>
    CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Point Average and is one of the most important academic indicators for students.
    It reflects overall performance across semesters and is often used during internships, placements, and higher studies.
  </p>
  <p>
    This CGPA calculator helps you calculate your CGPA using the total grade points earned and the total number of credits.
    The formula used is simple: CGPA = Total Grade Points ÷ Total Credits.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if your total grade points are 720 and total credits are 80, then your CGPA will be 9.00.
    This calculator eliminates manual errors and provides accurate results instantly.
  </p>

  <h2>Attendance Calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Attendance is a crucial requirement in most colleges and universities. Many institutions require a minimum
    attendance percentage to allow students to appear for examinations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This attendance calculator helps you calculate your attendance percentage by dividing the number of classes attended
    by the total number of classes conducted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowing your attendance early allows you to plan better and avoid shortages.
    This tool is especially useful before exams or internal assessments.
  </p>

  <input type="number" id="present" placeholder="Classes attended">
  <input type="number" id="total" placeholder="Total classes conducted">

  <h2>Percentage Calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Percentage calculation is commonly required during exams, assignments, and result analysis.
    This calculator helps you calculate percentage easily based on marks obtained and maximum marks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The formula used is: (Marks Obtained ÷ Maximum Marks) × 100.
    The result helps students understand their performance clearly.
  </p>
  <p>
    This calculator is useful for school students, college students, and anyone who needs quick percentage calculations.
